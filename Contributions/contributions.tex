The multidisciplinary nature of the studies here presented required the valuable contributions of my collaborators. This will be further detailed at the start of each chapter, but will also be here summarised.

\begin{itemize}
\item In Chapter 2, the original experiments were designed by Ricardo J Miragaia, who also assisted in data interpretation.
\item In Chapter 3, the original concept was conceived together with Valentine Svensson.

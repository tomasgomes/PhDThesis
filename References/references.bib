A fundamental challenge of biology is to understand the vast heterogeneity of cells, particularly how cellular composition, structure, and morphology are linked to cellular physiology. Unfortunately, conventional technologies are limited in uncovering these relations. We present a machine-intelligence technology based on a radically different architecture that realizes real-time image-based intelligent cell sorting at an unprecedented rate. This technology, which we refer to as intelligent image-activated cell sorting, integrates high-throughput cell microscopy, focusing, and sorting on a hybrid software-hardware data-management infrastructure, enabling real-time automated operation for data acquisition, data processing, decision-making, and actuation. We use it to demonstrate real-time sorting of microalgal and blood cells based on intracellular protein localization and cell-cell interaction from large heterogeneous populations for studying photosynthesis and atherothrombosis, respectively. The technology is highly versatile and expected to enable machine-based scientific discovery in biological, pharmaceutical, and medical sciences.},

	abstract = {A novel instrument for real time analysis of individual biological cells or other microparticles is described. The instrument is based on inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry and comprises a three-aperture plasma−vacuum interface, a dc quadrupole turning optics for decoupling ions from neutral components, an rf quadrupole ion guide discriminating against low-mass dominant plasma ions, a point-to-parallel focusing dc quadrupole doublet, an orthogonal acceleration reflectron analyzer, a discrete dynode fast ion detector, and an 8-bit 1 GHz digitizer. A high spectrum generation frequency of 76.8 kHz provides capability for collecting multiple spectra from each particle-induced transient ion cloud, typically of 200−300 μs duration. It is shown that the transients can be resolved and characterized individually at a peak frequency of 1100 particles per second. Design considerations and optimization data are presented. The figures of merit of the instrument are measured under standard inductively coupled plasma (ICP) operating conditions ({\textless}3\% cerium oxide ratio). At mass resolution (full width at half-maximum) M/ΔM {\textgreater} 900 for m/z = 159, the sensitivity with a standard sample introduction system of {\textgreater}1.4 × 108 ion counts per second per mg L−1 of Tb and an abundance sensitivity of (6 × 10−4)−(1.4 × 10−3) (trailing and leading masses, respectively) are shown. The mass range (m/z = 125−215) and abundance sensitivity are sufficient for elemental immunoassay with up to 60 distinct available elemental tags. When {\textless}15 elemental tags are used, a higher sensitivity mode at lower resolution (M/ΔM {\textgreater} 500) can be used, which provides {\textgreater}2.4 × 108 cps per mg L-1 of Tb, at (1.5 × 10−3)−(5.0 × 10−3) abundance sensitivity. The real-time simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes from individual 1.8 μm polystyrene beads labeled with lanthanides is shown. A real time single cell 20 antigen expression assay of model cell lines and leukemia patient samples immuno-labeled with lanthanide-tagged antibodies is presented.},

We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although {\textgreater}90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3′ untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 × 105 distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

Using our mRNA-Seq assay with only a single mouse blastomere, we detected the expression of 75\% (5,270) more genes than microarray techniques and identified 1,753 previously unknown splice junctions called by at least 5 reads. Moreover, 8–19\% of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells. Finally, for Dicer1−/− and Ago2−/− (Eif2c2−/−) oocytes, we found that 1,696 and 1,553 genes, respectively, were abnormally upregulated compared to wild-type controls, with 619 genes in common.},

Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data were projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves—all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the transcriptomes of 85 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology, and disease.},

We determined the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that although gene expression estimates from single cells have increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we identified distinct gene expression patterns, including candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells.

Cells, the basic units of biological structure and function, vary broadly in type and state. Single-cell genomics can characterize cell identity and function, but limitations of ease and scale have prevented its broad application. Here we describe Drop-seq, a strategy for quickly profiling thousands of individual cells by separating them into nanoliter-sized aqueous droplets, associating a different barcode with each cell’s RNAs, and sequencing them all together. Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts’ cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes. Drop-seq will accelerate biological discovery by enabling routine transcriptional profiling at single-cell resolution.

It has long been the dream of biologists to map gene expression at the single-cell level. With such data one might track heterogeneous cell sub-populations, and infer regulatory relationships between genes and pathways. Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single-cell resolution. What is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for quantitative in-depth sequencing. We have developed a high-throughput droplet-microfluidic approach for barcoding the RNA from thousands of individual cells for subsequent analysis by next-generation sequencing. The method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. We analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) withdrawal. The reproducibility of these high-throughput single-cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.

Patterns of gene expression can be used to characterize and classify neuronal types. It is challenging, however, to generate taxonomies that fulfill the essential criteria of being comprehensive, harmonizing with conventional classification schemes, and lacking superfluous subdivisions of genuine types. To address these challenges, we used massively parallel single-cell RNA profiling and optimized computational methods on a heterogeneous class of neurons, mouse retinal bipolar cells (BCs). From a population of ∼25,000 BCs, we derived a molecular classification that identified 15 types, including all types observed previously and two novel types, one of which has a non-canonical morphology and position. We validated the classification scheme and identified dozens of novel markers using methods that match molecular expression to cell morphology. This work provides a systematic methodology for achieving comprehensive molecular classification of neurons, identifies novel neuronal types, and uncovers transcriptional differences that distinguish types within a class.},

The recent development of single-cell genomic techniques allows us to profile gene expression at the single-cell level easily, although many of these methods have limited throughput. Rosenberg et al. describe a strategy called split-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing, or SPLiT-seq, which uses combinatorial barcoding to profile single-cell transcriptomes without requiring the physical isolation of each cell. The authors used their method to profile {\textgreater}100,000 single-cell transcriptomes from mouse brains and spinal cords at 2 and 11 days after birth. Comparisons with in situ hybridization data on RNA expression from Allen Institute atlases linked these transcriptomes with spatial mapping, from which developmental lineages could be identified.
Science, this issue p. 176
To facilitate scalable profiling of single cells, we developed split-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing (SPLiT-seq), a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) method that labels the cellular origin of RNA through combinatorial barcoding. SPLiT-seq is compatible with fixed cells or nuclei, allows efficient sample multiplexing, and requires no customized equipment. We used SPLiT-seq to analyze 156,049 single-nucleus transcriptomes from postnatal day 2 and 11 mouse brains and spinal cords. More than 100 cell types were identified, with gene expression patterns corresponding to cellular function, regional specificity, and stage of differentiation. Pseudotime analysis revealed transcriptional programs driving four developmental lineages, providing a snapshot of early postnatal development in the murine central nervous system. SPLiT-seq provides a path toward comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of other similarly complex multicellular systems.
Single-cell analyses with SPLiT-seq (split-pool ligation-based transcriptome sequencing) elucidate development of the mouse nervous system.

One of the most popular algorithms for uncovering community structure is the so-called Louvain algorithm. We show that this algorithm has a major defect that largely went unnoticed until now: the Louvain algorithm may yield arbitrarily badly connected communities. In the worst case, communities may even be disconnected, especially when running the algorithm iteratively. In our experimental analysis, we observe that up to 25\% of the communities are badly connected and up to 16\% are disconnected. To address this problem, we introduce the Leiden algorithm. We prove that the Leiden algorithm yields communities that are guaranteed to be connected. In addition, we prove that, when the Leiden algorithm is applied iteratively, it converges to a partition in which all subsets of all communities are locally optimally assigned. Furthermore, by relying on a fast local move approach, the Leiden algorithm runs faster than the Louvain algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the Leiden algorithm for several benchmark and real-world networks. We find that the Leiden algorithm is faster than the Louvain algorithm and uncovers better partitions, in addition to providing explicit guarantees.},

This identified numerous distinct cell types, covering all major root tissues and developmental stages, and illuminated specific marker genes for these populations. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of this approach to study the impact of environmental conditions on developmental processes. Analysis of roots grown with or without sucrose supplementation uncovers changes in the relative frequencies of cell types in response to sucrose. Finally, we characterize the transcriptome changes that occur across endodermis development and identify nearly 800 genes with dynamic expression as this tissue differentiates.

Blood contains many types of cells, including many immune system components. Immune cells used to be characterized by marker-based assays, but now classification relies on the genes that cells express. Villani et al. used deep sequencing at the single-cell level and unbiased clustering to define six dendritic cell and four monocyte populations. This refined analysis has identified, among others, a previously unknown dendritic cell population that potently activates T cells. Further cell culture revealed possible differentiation progenitors within the different cell populations.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONDendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes consist of multiple specialized subtypes that play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood, as these populations have historically been defined by a combination of morphology, physical properties, localization, functions, developmental origins, and expression of a restricted set of surface markers.
RATIONALETo overcome this inherently biased strategy for cell identification, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of {\textasciitilde}2400 cells isolated from healthy blood donors and enriched for HLA-DR+ lineage− cells. This single-cell profiling strategy and unbiased genomic classification, together with follow-up profiling and functional and phenotypic characterization of prospectively isolated subsets, led us to identify and validate six DC subtypes and four monocyte subtypes, and thus revise the taxonomy of these cells.
RESULTSOur study reveals: 1) A new DC subset, representing 2 to 3\% of the DC populations across all 10 donors tested, characterized by the expression of AXL, SIGLEC1, and SIGLEC6 antigens, named AS DCs. The AS DC population further divides into two populations captured in the traditionally defined plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and CD1C+ conventional DC (cDC) gates. This split is further reflected through AS DC gene expression signatures spanning a spectrum between cDC-like and pDC-like gene sets. Although AS DCs share properties with pDCs, they more potently activate T cells. This discovery led us to reclassify pDCs as the originally described “natural interferon-producing cells (IPCs)” with weaker T cell proliferation induction ability.2) A new subdivision within the CD1C+ DC subset: one defined by a major histocompatibility complex class II–like gene set and one by a CD14+ monocyte–like prominent gene set. These CD1C+ DC subsets, which can be enriched by combining CD1C with CD32B, CD36, and CD163 antigens, can both potently induce T cell proliferation.3) The existence of a circulating and dividing cDC progenitor giving rise to CD1C+ and CLEC9A+ DCs through in vitro differentiation assays. This blood precursor is defined by the expression of CD100+CD34int and observed at a frequency of {\textasciitilde}0.02\% of the LIN–HLA-DR+ fraction.4) Two additional monocyte populations: one expressing classical monocyte genes and cytotoxic genes, and the other with unknown functions.5) Evidence for a relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia (BPDCN) cells and healthy DCs.
CONCLUSIONOur revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease. The discovery of AS DCs within the traditionally defined pDC population explains many of the cDC properties previously assigned to pDCs, highlighting the need to revisit the definition of pDCs. Furthermore, the discovery of blood cDC progenitors represents a new therapeutic target readily accessible in the bloodstream for manipulation, as well as a new source for better in vitro DC generation. Although the current results focus on DCs and monocytes, a similar strategy can be applied to build a comprehensive human immune cell atlas. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/356/6335/eaah4573/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Establishing a human blood monocyte and dendritic cell atlas.We isolated {\textasciitilde}2400 cells enriched from the healthy human blood lineage− HLA-DR+ compartment and subjected them to single-cell RNA sequencing.

Dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes play a central role in pathogen sensing, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation and consist of multiple specialized subtypes. However, their identities and interrelationships are not fully understood. Using unbiased single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of {\textasciitilde}2400 cells, we identified six human DCs and four monocyte subtypes in human blood. Our study reveals a new DC subset that shares properties with plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) but potently activates T cells, thus redefining pDCs; a new subdivision within the CD1C+ subset of DCs; the relationship between blastic plasmacytoid DC neoplasia cells and healthy DCs; and circulating progenitor of conventional DCs (cDCs). Our revised taxonomy will enable more accurate functional and developmental analyses as well as immune monitoring in health and disease.
Discovery of additional immune cell subtypes will help identify functions and immune monitoring during disease.

Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the ‘transcriptomic landscape’ as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions between them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of ‘time-resolved’ differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organisation.

	abstract = {Fork in the road for immune cells
Immune cell differentiation along T helper pathways can profoundly influence the nature of the immune response—from promoting allergy to enhancing inflammation. Lönnberg et al. use single-cell transcriptomics and computational modeling to delineate the molecular cues that guide this decision. During blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice, the authors track TH1/TFH bifurcation at both the population and single-clone levels and identify genes associated with each path. They demonstrate roles of particular cell types in shaping this decision. This approach provides a broad framework for modeling immune cell differentiation in vivo.
Differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into functionally distinct T helper (TH) subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Because of extensive heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational analysis with a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of TH1 and TFH (T follicular helper) cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous T cell receptor sequences, we first demonstrated that TH1/TFH bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression was associated with TH1 or TFH fates and demonstrated a T cell–intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting TH1 differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular relationship between TH1 and interleukin-10–producing Tr1 cells in this infection. TH1 and TFH fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that up-regulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell interaction in driving TH1/TFH fates. In particular, we found that precursor TH cells were coached toward a TH1 but not a TFH fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources: a database, www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling TH1/TFH fate commitment, and, more generally, GPfates, a modeling framework for characterizing cell differentiation toward multiple fates.
Computational modeling defines T helper cell differentiation toward multiple fates during experimental malaria.

Subsequently, cells migrate, either surrounding the prospective ectoderm contributing to the embryo proper, or into the extra-embryonic region to form the yolk sac, umbilical cord and placenta. Fate mapping has shown that mature tissues such as blood and heart originate from specific regions of the pre-gastrula epiblast1, but the plasticity of cells within the embryo and the function of key cell-type-specific transcription factors remain unclear. Here we analyse 1,205 cells from the epiblast and nascent Flk1+ mesoderm of gastrulating mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing, representing the first transcriptome-wide in vivo view of early mesoderm formation during mammalian gastrulation. Additionally, using knockout mice, we study the function of Tal1, a key haematopoietic transcription factor, and demonstrate, contrary to previous studies performed using retrospective assays2,3, that Tal1 knockout does not immediately bias precursor cells towards a cardiac fate.},

Therefore, efficient computational tools for combining diverse datasets are crucial for biology in the single cell genomics era. A number of methods have been developed to assist data integration by removing technical batch effects, but most are computationally intensive. To overcome the challenge of enormous datasets, we have developed BBKNN, an extremely fast graph-based data integration method. We illustrate the power of BBKNN for dimensionalityreduced visualisation and clustering in multiple biological scenarios, including a massive integrative study over several murine atlases. BBKNN successfully connects cell populations across experimentally heterogeneous mouse scRNA-Seq datasets, which reveals global markers of cell type and organspecificity and provides the foundation for inferring the underlying transcription factor network.

Here, we develop a strategy to "anchor" diverse datasets together, enabling us to integrate single-cell measurements not only across scRNA-seq technologies, but also across different modalities. After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations. Lastly, we harmonize \textit{in situ} gene expression and scRNA-seq datasets, allowing transcriptome-wide imputation of spatial gene expression patterns.

We present a strategy for batch correction based on the detection of mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) in the high-dimensional expression space. Our approach does not rely on predefined or equal population compositions across batches; instead, it requires only that a subset of the population be shared between batches. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared with existing methods by using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data sets. Using multiple droplet-based scRNA-seq data sets, we demonstrate that our MNN batch-effect-correction method can be scaled to large numbers of cells.},

Although the interest in scRNA-seq has rapidly grown in recent years, the existing methods are plagued by many challenges when performing scRNA-seq on multiple samples. To simultaneously analyze multiple samples with scRNA-seq, we developed a universal sample barcoding method through transient transfection with short barcode oligonucleotides. By conducting a species-mixing experiment, we have validated the accuracy of our method and confirmed the ability to identify multiplets and negatives. Samples from a 48-plex drug treatment experiment were pooled and analyzed by a single run of Drop-Seq. This revealed unique transcriptome responses for each drug and target-specific gene expression signatures at the single-cell level. Our cost-effective method is widely applicable for the single-cell profiling of multiple experimental conditions, enabling the widespread adoption of scRNA-seq for various applications.

Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation4,5,6,7,8, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical DNA sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian DNA regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)9 integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments10 de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of DNA accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the ‘regulome’.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding how gene expression in single cells progress over time is vital for revealing the mechanisms governing cell fate transitions. RNA velocity, which infers immediate changes in gene expression by comparing levels of new (unspliced) versus mature (spliced) transcripts (La Manno et al. 2018), represents an important advance to these efforts. A key question remaining is whether it is possible to predict the most probable cell state backward or forward over arbitrary time-scales. To this end, we introduce an inclusive model (termed Dynamo) capable of predicting cell states over extended time periods, that incorporates promoter state switching, transcription, splicing, translation and RNA/protein degradation by taking advantage of scRNA-seq and the co-assay of transcriptome and proteome. We also implement scSLAM-seq by extending SLAM-seq to plate-based scRNA-seq (Hendriks et al. 2018; Erhard et al. 2019; Cao, Zhou, et al. 2019) and augment the model by explicitly incorporating the metabolic labelling of nascent RNA. We show that through careful design of labelling experiments and an efficient mathematical framework, the entire kinetic behavior of a cell from this model can be robustly and accurately inferred. Aided by the improved framework, we show that it is possible to reconstruct the transcriptomic vector field from sparse and noisy vector samples generated by single cell experiments. The reconstructed vector field further enables global mapping of potential landscapes that reflects the relative stability of a given cell state, and the minimal transition time and most probable paths between any cell states in the state space. This work thus foreshadows the possibility of predicting long-term trajectories of cells during a dynamic process instead of short time velocity estimates.

Mapping gene expression at the single-cell level within tissues remains a technical challenge. Rodriques et al. developed a method called Slide-seq, whereby RNA was spatially resolved from tissue sections by transfer onto a surface covered with DNA-barcoded beads. Applying Slide-seq to regions of a mouse brain revealed spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum and axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments. The authors used this method to dissect the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.
Science, this issue p. 1463
Spatial positions of cells in tissues strongly influence function, yet a high-throughput, genome-wide readout of gene expression with cellular resolution is lacking. We developed Slide-seq, a method for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. Using Slide-seq, we localized cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus, characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, and defined the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. These studies highlight how Slide-seq provides a scalable method for obtaining spatially resolved gene expression data at resolutions comparable to the sizes of individual cells.
An RNA sequencing technique is developed that can measure genome-wide gene expression in complex tissues at 10-micrometer resolution.

Single-cell RNA-Seq captures molecular profiles but not spatial organization. Conversely, spatial profiling assays to date have lacked global transcriptome information, throughput or single-cell resolution. Here, we develop High-Density Spatial Transcriptomics (HDST), a method for RNA-Seq at high spatial resolution. Spatially barcoded reverse transcription oligonucleotides are coupled to beads that are randomly deposited into tightly packed individual microsized wells on a slide. The position of each bead is decoded with sequential hybridization using complementary oligonucleotides providing a unique bead-specific spatial address. We then capture, and spatially \textit{in situ} barcode, RNA from the histological tissue sections placed on the HDST array. HDST recovers hundreds of thousands of transcript-coupled spatial barcodes per experiment at 2 μm resolution. We demonstrate HDST in the mouse brain, use it to resolve spatial expression patterns and cell types, and show how to combine it with histological stains to relate expression patterns to tissue architecture and anatomy. HDST opens the way to spatial analysis of tissues at high resolution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONThe complete sequence of animal genomes has had a transformative impact on biological research. Whereas the genome sequence of an organism contains the information for its development and physiology, the transcriptomes (the sets of actively transcribed genes) of the cell types in an organism define how the genome is used for the unique functions of its cells. Cell number and complexity have historically made the identification of all cell types, much less their transcriptomes, an extreme challenge for most multicellular organisms. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (SCS) have greatly enhanced the ability to determine cell type transcriptomes, with SCS of thousands of cells readily achievable.
RATIONALEWe reasoned that it might be possible, given these advances, to determine the transcriptomes of essentially every cell type of a complete organism possessing an unknown number of cell types. The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, famous for its regeneration ability, is an attractive case study for such an undertaking. Planarians possess a complex anatomy with diverse differentiated cell types, including many found across animals. Furthermore, planarians contain a proliferating cell population called neoblasts that includes pluripotent stem cells. Neoblasts mediate regeneration and constitutive tissue turnover. Consequently, lineage precursors for essentially all differentiated cells types are also present in adults. Finally, planarians constitutively express positional information guiding tissue turnover. Therefore, comprehensive SCS at a single time point (the adult) could allow transcriptome determination for all differentiated cell types and for lineage precursors, and could identify patterning information that guides new cell production and organization. Capturing this information in most organisms would require sampling adults and many transient embryonic stages.
RESULTSWe used the SCS method Drop-seq to determine the transcriptomes for 66,783 individual cells from adult planarians. We locally saturated cell type coverage by iteratively sequencing distinct body regions and assessing the frequency of known rare cell types in the data. Clustering the cells by shared gene expression grouped cells into broad tissue classes. Subclustering of each broad tissue type in isolation enabled separation of cells into the cell populations constituting each tissue. These analyses enabled the identification of a previously unidentified tissue group and the classification of poorly characterized tissues into their constituent cell types, including numerous previously unknown cell types. Transcriptomes were identified for many rare cell types, including those that exist as rarely as {\textasciitilde}10 cells in an animal that has 105 to 106 cells, which suggests that near-to-complete cellular saturation was reached. In addition, transcriptomes for known and novel lineage precursors, from pluripotent stem cell to differentiated cell types, were generated. Precursor transcriptomes identified transcription factors required for maintenance of associated differentiated cells during homeostatic cell turnover. Finally, the data were used to identify genes regionally expressed in muscle, which is the site of planarian patterning gene expression.
CONCLUSIONWe successfully used SCS to generate transcriptomes for most to all cells of a complete organism. This resource provides a wealth of data regarding the cellular site of expression of thousands of conserved genes and the transcriptomes for cell types widely used in animals. These data will inform studies of these genes and cell types broadly, and will provide a resource for the fields of planarian biology and comparative evolutionary biology. This work also provides a template for the generation of cell type transcriptome atlases, which can be applied to a large array of organisms. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/360/6391/eaaq1736/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint An atlas of planarian cell type transcriptomes.High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing of adult planarians reveals a cell type transcriptome atlas that includes rare cell types and many novel cell populations, cellular transition states, and patterning information, as demonstrated by two regionally expressed genes in muscle.
The transcriptome of a cell dictates its unique cell type biology. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes for essentially every cell type of a complete animal: the regenerative planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. Planarians contain a diverse array of cell types, possess lineage progenitors for differentiated cells (including pluripotent stem cells), and constitutively express positional information, making them ideal for this undertaking. We generated data for 66,783 cells, defining transcriptomes for known and many previously unknown planarian cell types and for putative transition states between stem and differentiated cells. We also uncovered regionally expressed genes in muscle, which harbors positional information. Identifying the transcriptomes for potentially all cell types for many organisms should be readily attainable and represents a powerful approach to metazoan biology.

Single-cell sequencing is challenging owing to the limited biological material available in an individual cell and the high cost of sequencing across multiple cells. Cao et al. developed a two-step combinatorial barcoding method to profile both single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomes without requiring physical isolation of each cell. The authors profiled almost 50,000 single cells from an individual Caenorhabditis elegans larval stage and were able to identify and recover information from different, even rare, cell types.
Science, this issue p. 661
To resolve cellular heterogeneity, we developed a combinatorial indexing strategy to profile the transcriptomes of single cells or nuclei, termed sci-RNA-seq (single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). We applied sci-RNA-seq to profile nearly 50,000 cells from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans at the L2 larval stage, which provided {\textgreater}50-fold “shotgun” cellular coverage of its somatic cell composition. From these data, we defined consensus expression profiles for 27 cell types and recovered rare neuronal cell types corresponding to as few as one or two cells in the L2 worm. We integrated these profiles with whole-animal chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data to deconvolve the cell type–specific effects of transcription factors. The data generated by sci-RNA-seq constitute a powerful resource for nematode biology and foreshadow similar atlases for other organisms.

Here, we present scGen, a model combining variational autoencoders and latent space vector arithmetics for high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. In benchmarks across a broad range of examples, we show that scGen accurately models dose and infection response of cells across cell types, studies and species. In particular, we demonstrate that scGen learns cell type and species specific response implying that it captures features that distinguish responding from non-responding genes and cells. With the upcoming availability of large-scale atlases of organs in healthy state, we envision scGen to become a tool for experimental design through in silico screening of perturbation response in the context of disease and drug treatment.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is an emerging technology for profiling the gene expression of thousands of cells at the single cell resolution. Currently, the labeling of cells in an scRNA-seq dataset is performed by manually characterizing clusters of cells or by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Both methods have inherent drawbacks: The first depends on the clustering algorithm used and the knowledge and arbitrary decisions of the annotator, and the second involves an experimental step in addition to the sequencing and cannot be incorporated into the higher throughput scRNA-seq methods. We therefore suggest a different approach for cell labeling, namely, classifying cells from scRNA-seq datasets by using a model transferred from different (previously labeled) datasets. This approach can complement existing methods, and–in some cases–even replace them. Such a transfer-learning framework requires selecting informative features and training a classifier. The specific implementation for the framework that we propose, designated ''CaSTLe–classification of single cells by transfer learning,'' is based on a robust feature engineering workflow and an XGBoost classification model built on these features. Evaluation of CaSTLe against two benchmark feature-selection and classification methods showed that it outperformed the benchmark methods in most cases and yielded satisfactory classification accuracy in a consistent manner. CaSTLe has the additional advantage of being parallelizable and well suited to large datasets. We showed that it was possible to classify cell types using transfer learning, even when the databases contained a very small number of genes, and our study thus indicates the potential applicability of this approach for analysis of scRNA-seq datasets.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed biomedical research, enabling decomposition of complex tissues into disaggregated, functionally distinct cell types. For many applications, investigators wish to identify cell types with known marker genes. Typically, such cell type assignments are performed through unsupervised clustering followed by manual annotation based on these marker genes, or via "mapping" procedures to existing data. However, the manual interpretation required in the former case scales poorly to large datasets, which are also often prone to batch effects, while existing data for purified cell types must be available for the latter. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering can be error-prone, leading to under- and over- clustering of the cell types of interest. To overcome these issues we present CellAssign, a probabilistic model that leverages prior knowledge of cell type marker genes to annotate scRNA-seq data into pre-defined and de novo cell types. CellAssign automates the process of assigning cells in a highly scalable manner across large datasets while simultaneously controlling for batch and patient effects. We demonstrate the analytical advantages of CellAssign through extensive simulations and exemplify real-world utility to profile the spatial dynamics of high-grade serous ovarian cancer and the temporal dynamics of follicular lymphoma. Our analysis reveals subclonal malignant phenotypes and points towards an evolutionary interplay between immune and cancer cell populations with cancer cells escaping immune recognition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Current methods for assigning cell types typically involve the use of unsupervised clustering, the identification of signature genes in each cluster, followed by a manual lookup of these genes in the literature and databases to assign cell types. However, there are several limitations associated with these approaches, such as unwanted sources of variation that influence clustering and a lack of canonical markers for certain cell types. Here, we present ACTINN (Automated Cell Type Identification using Neural Networks), which employs a neural network with 3 hidden layers, trains on datasets with predefined cell types, and predicts cell types for other datasets based on the trained parameters. We trained the neural network on a mouse cell type atlas (Tabula Muris Atlas) and a human immune cell dataset, and used it to predict cell types for mouse leukocytes, human PBMCs and human T cell sub types. The results showed that our neural network is fast and accurate, and should therefore be a useful tool to complement existing scRNA-seq pipelines.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Further study of single cell profiles across different conditions enables the understanding of biological processes and underlying mechanisms at the sub-population level.

We have developed ClusterMap, a systematic method and workflow to facilitate the comparison of scRNA profiles across distinct biological contexts. Using hierarchical clustering of the marker genes of each sub-group, ClusterMap matches the sub-types of cells across different samples and provides similarity as a metric to quantify the quality of the match. We introduce a purity tree cut method designed specifically for this matching problem. We use Circos plot and regrouping method to visualize the results concisely. Furthermore, we propose a new metric separability to summarize sub-population changes among all sample pairs.

An important facet of these studies is the ability to identify the transcriptional signatures that define a cell type or state. In theory, this information can be used to classify an unknown cell based on its transcriptional profile; and clearly, the ability to accurately predict a cell type and any pathologic-related state will play a critical role in the early diagnosis of disease and decisions around the personalized treatment for patients. Here we present a new generalizable method (\textit{scPred}) for prediction of cell type(s), using a combination of unbiased feature selection from a reduced-dimension space, and machine-learning classification. \textit{scPred} solves several problems associated with the identification of individual gene feature selection, and is able to capture subtle effects of many genes, increasing the overall variance explained by the model, and correspondingly improving the prediction accuracy. We validate the performance of scPred by performing experiments to classify tumor versus non-tumor epithelial cells in gastric cancer, then using independent molecular techniques (cyclic immunohistochemistry) to confirm our prediction, achieving an accuracy of classifying the disease state of individual cells of 99\%. Moreover, we apply \textit{scPred} to scRNA-seq data from pancreatic tissue, colorectal tumor biopsies, and circulating dendritic cells, and show that \textit{scPred} is able to classify cell subtypes with an accuracy of 96.1-99.2\%. Collectively, our results demonstrate the utility of \textit{scPred} as a single cell prediction method that can be used for a wide variety of applications.

Analysis of gene expression in single cells allows for decomposition of cellular states as low-dimensional latent spaces. However, the interpretation and validation of these spaces remains a challenge. Here, we present scCoGAPS, which defines latent spaces from a source single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, and projectR, which evaluates these latent spaces in independent target datasets via transfer learning. Application of developing mouse retina to scRNA-Seq reveals intrinsic relationships across biological contexts and assays while avoiding batch effects and other technical features. We compare the dimensions learned in this source dataset to adult mouse retina, a time-course of human retinal development, select scRNA-seq datasets from developing brain, chromatin accessibility data, and a murine-cell type atlas to identify shared biological features. These tools lay the groundwork for exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via latent space representations, enabling a shift in how we compare and identify cells beyond reliance on marker genes or ensemble molecular identity.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}To understand the molecular pathogenesis of human disease, precision analyses to define molecular alterations within (and between) disease-associated cell populations are desperately needed. Single-cell genomics represents an ideal platform to enable the identification and comparison of normal and diseased transcriptional cell states. We note that disease-associated perturbations usually retain cellular-identity programs (core genes), providing an appropriate reference for secondary comparison analyses. Thus, we created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis and classification of cell types from diverse scRNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony is an automated and easy-to-use tool that efficiently matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community clustering and alignment strategy. Utilizing core genes and community clustering to reveal disease and cell-state systems-level insights overcomes bias toward donor and disease effects that can be imposed by joint-alignment approaches. Moreover, cellHarmony directly compares cell frequencies and gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner, then produces a holistic representation of these differences across potentially dozens of cell populations and impacted regulatory networks. Using this approach, we identify gene regulatory programs that are selectively impacted in distinct hematopoietic and heart cell populations that suggest novel disease mechanisms and drug targets. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To address this challenge, we have developed \textit{Moana}, a hierarchical machine learning framework that enables the construction of robust cell type classifiers from heterogeneous scRNA-Seq datasets. To demonstrate \textit{Moana}’s capabilities, we construct cell type classifiers for human immune cells that accurately distinguish between closely related cell types in the presence of experimental perturbations and systematic differences between scRNA-Seq protocols. We show that \textit{Moana} is generally applicable and scales to datasets with more than ten thousand cells, thus enabling the construction of tissue-specific cell type atlases that can be directly applied to analyze new scRNASeq datasets.

Defining cell types requires integrating diverse single-cell measurements from multiple experiments and biological contexts. To flexibly model single-cell datasets, we developed LIGER, an algorithm that delineates shared and dataset-specific features of cell identity. We applied it to four diverse and challenging analyses of human and mouse brain cells. First, we defined region-specific and sexually dimorphic gene expression in the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Second, we analyzed expression in the human substantia nigra, comparing cell states in specific donors and relating cell types to those in the mouse. Third, we integrated in situ and single-cell expression data to spatially locate fine subtypes of cells present in the mouse frontal cortex. Finally, we jointly defined mouse cortical cell types using single-cell RNA-seq and DNA methylation profiles, revealing putative mechanisms of cell-type-specific epigenomic regulation. Integrative analyses using LIGER promise to accelerate investigations of cell-type definition, gene regulation, and disease states.},

A near-universal step in the analysis of single cell RNA-Seq data is to hypothesize the identity of each cell. Often, this is achieved by finding cells that express combinations of marker genes that had previously been implicated as being cell-type specific, an approach that is not quantitative and does not explicitly take advantage of other single cell RNA-Seq studies. Here, we describe our tool, SingleCellNet, which addresses these issues and enables the classification of query single cell RNA-Seq data in comparison to reference single cell RNA-Seq data. SingleCellNet compares favorably to other methods, and it is notably able to make sensitive and accurate classifications across platforms and species. We demonstrate how SingleCellNet can be used to classify previously undetermined cells, and how it can be used to assess the outcome of cell fate engineering experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Highlight{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}SingleCellNet (SCN) enables the classification of scRNA-Seq data across platforms and species{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}SCN is open source and extendible{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We illustrate the utility of SCN with three example applications{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, current analyses of scRNA-Seq data usually start from unsupervised clustering or visualization. These methods ignore the prior knowledge of transcriptomes and of the probable structures of the data. Moreover, cell identification heavily relies on subjective and inaccurate human inspection afterwards. We reversed this paradigm and developed SCINA, a semi-supervised model, for analyses of scRNA-Seq and flow cytometry/CyTOF data, and other data of similar format, by automatically exploiting previously established gene signatures using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We applied SCINA on a wide range of datasets, and showed its accuracy, stableness and efficiency exceeded most popular unsupervised approaches. Notably, SCINA discovered an intermediate stage of oligodendrocyte from mouse brain scRNA-Seq data. SCINA also detected immune cell population shifting in \textit{Stk4} knock-out mouse cytometry data. Finally, SCINA identified a new kidney tumor clade with similarity to FH-deficient tumors from bulk tumor data. Overall, SCINA provides both methodological advances and biological insights from perspectives different from traditional analytical methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The origin of this revolution was arguably the deep learning approach by the Hinton lab in 2012, which halved the error rate of existing classifiers in the then 2-year-old ImageNet database$^{\textrm{1}}$. In hindsight, the combination of algorithmic and hardware advances with the appearance of large and well-labeled datasets has led up to this seminal contribution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The emergence of large amounts of data from single-cell RNA-seq and the recent global effort to chart all cell types in the Human Cell Atlas has attracted an interest in deep-learning applications. However, all current approaches are unsupervised, i.e., learning of latent spaces without using any cell labels, even though supervised learning approaches are often more powerful in feature learning and the most popular approach in the current AI revolution by far.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Here, we ask why this is the case. In particular we ask whether supervised deep learning can be used for cell annotation, \textit{i.e.} to predict cell-type labels from single-cell gene expression profiles. After evaluating 6 classification methods across 14 datasets, we notably find that deep learning does not outperform classical machine-learning methods in the task. Thus, cell-type prediction based on gene-signature derived cell-type labels is potentially too simplistic a task for complex non-linear methods, which demands better labels of functional single-cell readouts. We, therefore, are still waiting for the “ImageNet moment” in single-cell genomics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The secreted proteins induced by Con A were analyzed by biosynthetic labeling and SDS gel electrophoresis, and significant differences were seen between the two groups of T cell line. Both types of T cell grew in response to alternating cycles of antigen stimulation, followed by growth in IL 2-containing medium. Examples of both types of T cell were also specific for or restricted by the I region of the MHC, and the surface marker phenotype of the majority of both types was Ly-1+, Lyt-2-, L3T4+, Both types of helper T cell could provide help for B cells, but the nature of the help differed.

Depending on the tissue microenvironment, T cells can differentiate into highly diverse subsets expressing unique trafficking receptors and cytokines. Studies of human lymphocytes have primarily focused on a limited number of parameters in blood, representing an incomplete view of the human immune system. Here, we have utilized mass cytometry to simultaneously analyze T cell trafficking and functional markers across eight different human tissues, including blood, lymphoid, and non-lymphoid tissues. These data have revealed that combinatorial expression of trafficking receptors and cytokines better defines tissue specificity. Notably, we identified numerous T helper cell subsets with overlapping cytokine expression, but only specific cytokine combinations are secreted regardless of tissue type. This indicates that T cell lineages defined in mouse models cannot be clearly distinguished in humans. Overall, our data uncover a plethora of tissue immune signatures and provide a systemic map of how T cell phenotypes are altered throughout the human body.},

However, the conserved factors defining macrophages remain largely unknown. The transcription factor ZEB2 is best described for its role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition; however, its role within the immune system is only now being elucidated. We show here that \textit{Zeb2} expression is a conserved feature of macrophages. Using \textit{Clec4f-cre}, \textit{Itgax-cre}, and \textit{Fcgr1-cre} mice to target five different macrophage populations, we found that loss of ZEB2 resulted in macrophage disappearance from the tissues, coupled with their subsequent replenishment from bone-marrow precursors in open niches. Mechanistically, we found that ZEB2 functioned to maintain the tissue-specific identities of macrophages. In Kupffer cells, ZEB2 achieved this by regulating expression of the transcription factor LXRα, removal of which recapitulated the loss of Kupffer cell identity and disappearance. Thus, ZEB2 expression is required in macrophages to preserve their tissue-specific identities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Approximately 10\% of peripheral CD4+ cells and less than 1\% of CD8+ cells in normal unimmunized adult mice express the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25) molecules. When CD4+ cell suspensions prepared from BALB/c nu/+ mice lymph nodes and spleens were depleted of CD25+ cells by specific mAb and C, and then inoculated into BALB/c athymic nude (nu/nu) mice, all recipients spontaneously developed histologically and serologically evident autoimmune diseases (such as thyroiditis, gastritis, insulitis, sialoadenitis, adrenalitis, oophoritis, glomerulonephritis, and polyarthritis); some mice also developed graft-vs-host-like wasting disease. Reconstitution of CD4+CD25+ cells within a limited period after transfer of CD4+CD25- cells prevented these autoimmune developments in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas the reconstitution several days later, or inoculation of an equivalent dose of CD8+ cells, was far less efficient for the prevention. When nu/nu mice were transplanted with allogeneic skins or immunized with xenogeneic proteins at the time of CD25- cell inoculation, they showed significantly heightened immune responses to the skins or proteins, and reconstitution of CD4+CD25+ cells normalized the responses. Taken together, these results indicate that CD4+CD25+ cells contribute to maintaining self-tolerance by down-regulating immune response to self and non-self Ags in an Ag-nonspecific manner, presumably at the T cell activation stage; elimination/reduction of CD4+CD25+ cells relieves this general suppression, thereby not only enhancing immune responses to non-self Ags, but also eliciting autoimmune responses to certain self-Ags. Abnormality of this T cell-mediated mechanism of peripheral tolerance can be a possible cause of various autoimmune diseases.},

	abstract = {In recent years, it is recognized that acquired immunity is controlled by regulatory T cell (Treg). Since fundamental pathophysiological changes of allergy are mainly caused by hyperresponsiveness of immune system to allergens that acquires after birth, Tregs likely play key roles in the pathogenesis of allergy, particularly during the sensitization phase. However, accumulated information indicate that there are several distinctive subtypes of Tregs in man, and each of them seems to play different role in controlling immune system, which complicates the involvement of Tregs in allergy. The aim of the present study is to attempt to classify subtypes of Tregs and summarize their roles in allergy. Tregs should include natural Tregs (nTreg) including inducible costimulator (ICOS)(+) Tregs, inducible/adaptive Tregs (iTreg), interleukin (IL)-10-producing type 1 Tregs (Tr1 cells), CD8(+) Tregs and IL-17-producing Tregs. These cells share some common features including expression of Foxp3 (except for Tr1 cells), and secretion of inhibitory cytokine IL-10 and/or TGF-β. Furthermore, it is noticeable that Tregs likely contribute to allergic disorders such as dermatitis and airway inflammation, and play a crucial role in the treatment of allergy through their actions on suppression of effector T cells and inhibition of activation of mast cells and basophils. Modulation of functions of Tregs may provide a novel strategy to prevent and treat allergic diseases.},

Long recognized to be potent suppressors of immune responses, Foxp3+CD4+ regulatory T (Treg) cells are being rediscovered as regulators of nonimmunological processes. We describe a phenotypically and functionally distinct population of Treg cells that rapidly accumulated in the acutely injured skeletal muscle of mice, just as invading myeloid-lineage cells switched from a proinflammatory to a proregenerative state. A Treg population of similar phenotype accumulated in muscles of genetically dystrophic mice. Punctual depletion of Treg cells during the repair process prolonged the proinflammatory infiltrate and impaired muscle repair, while treatments that increased or decreased Treg activities diminished or enhanced (respectively) muscle damage in a dystrophy model. Muscle Treg cells expressed the growth factor Amphiregulin, which acted directly on muscle satellite cells in vitro and improved muscle repair in vivo. Thus, Treg cells and their products may provide new therapeutic opportunities for wound repair and muscular dystrophies.},

The maintenance of tissue homeostasis is critically dependent on the function of tissue-resident immune cells and the differentiation capacity of tissue-resident stem cells (SCs). How immune cells influence the function of SCs is largely unknown. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) in skin preferentially localize to hair follicles (HFs), which house a major subset of skin SCs (HFSCs). Here, we mechanistically dissect the role of Tregs in HF and HFSC biology. Lineage-specific cell depletion revealed that Tregs promote HF regeneration by augmenting HFSC proliferation and differentiation. Transcriptional and phenotypic profiling of Tregs and HFSCs revealed that skin-resident Tregs preferentially express high levels of the Notch ligand family member, Jagged 1 (Jag1). Expression of Jag1 on Tregs facilitated HFSC function and efficient HF regeneration. Taken together, our work demonstrates that Tregs in skin play a major role in HF biology by promoting the function of HFSCs.},

Therefore, understanding how the immune system modulates tissue healing is critical to design efficient regenerative strategies. While the innate immune system is well-known to be involved in the tissue healing process, the adaptive immune system has recently emerged as a key player. T-cells, in particular regulatory T-cells (Treg), have been shown to promote repair and regeneration of various organ systems.

The recent discovery of the differences between tissue-resident Treg cells and those derived from lymphoid organs is affecting the mindset of many investigators now questioning the broad applicability of observations originally based on peripheral blood/lymphoid organ cells. So far, the best characterized ‘Treg flavour’ comes from studies focused on their role in suppressing adipose tissue inflammation and obesity-driven insulin resistance. Adipose tissue derived Treg cells are distinct from their counterparts in lymphoid organs based on their transcriptional profile, T-cell receptor repertoire, and cytokine and chemokine receptor expression pattern. These cells are abundant in visceral adipose tissue of lean mice but their number is greatly reduced in insulin-resistant animal models of obesity. Interestingly, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor γ expression by visceral adipose tissue Treg cells is crucial for their accumulation, phenotype and function in the fat and surprisingly necessary for complete restoration of insulin sensitivity in obese mice by the anti-diabetic drug Pioglitazone. This review surveys recent findings relating to the unique phenotype and function of adipose tissue-resident Treg cells, speculates on the nature of their dynamics in lean and obese mouse models, and analyses their potential therapeutic application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

The intestine, and especially the colon, is a particularly suitable organ to study this question, given the variety of self-, microbiota- and food-derived antigens to which Treg cells and other T-cell populations are exposed. Intestinal environments can enhance conversion to a regulatory lineage8,9 and favour tolerogenic presentation of antigens to naive CD4+ T cells10,11, suggesting that intestinal homeostasis depends on microbiota-specific induced Treg cells12,13,14,15. Here, to identify the origin and antigen-specificity of intestinal Treg cells, we performed single-cell and high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor repertoires of CD4+ Foxp3+ and CD4+ Foxp3− T cells, and analysed their reactivity against specific commensal species. We show that thymus-derived Treg cells constitute most Treg cells in all lymphoid and intestinal organs, including the colon, where their repertoire is heavily influenced by the composition of the microbiota. Our results suggest that thymic Treg cells, and not induced Treg cells, dominantly mediate tolerance to antigens produced by intestinal commensals.},

In this Review, we describe new insights into the molecular controls that maintain the steady-state homeostasis of TReg cells and the cues that drive TReg cell adaptation to inflammation and/or different locations. We highlight how differing local milieu might drive context-specific TReg cell function and restoration of immune homeostasis, and how dysregulation of these processes can precipitate disease.},

	abstract = {CD4+Foxp3+ Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are a unique subset of helper T-cells, which regulate immune response and establish peripheral tolerance. Tregs not only maintain the tone and tenor of an immune response by dominant tolerance, but in recent years have also been identified as key players in resolving tissue inflammation and as mediators of tissue healing. Apart from being diverse in their origin (thymic and peripheral) and location (lymphoid and tissue resident), Tregs are also phenotypically heterogeneous as per the orientation of ongoing immune response. In this review, we discuss the recent advances in the field of Treg biology in general, and non-lymphoid and tissue resident Tregs in particular. We elaborate upon well-known visceral adipose tissue, colon, skin and tumor infiltrating Tregs and newly identified tissue Treg populations as in lungs, skeletal muscle, placenta and other tissues. Our attempt is to differentiate Tregs based on distinctive properties of their location, origin, ligand specificity, chemotaxis and specific suppressive mechanisms. Despite ever expanding roles in maintaining systemic homeostasis, Tregs are employed by large varieties of tumors to dampen anti-tumor immunity. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of Treg biology in the context of inflammation can be instrumental in effectively managing tissue transplantation, autoimmunity and anti-tumor immune responses.},

We collected and analyzed 40 published cancer microarray data sets, comprising 38 million gene expression measurements from {\textgreater}3,700 cancer samples. From this, we characterized a common transcriptional profile that is universally activated in most cancer types relative to the normal tissues from which they arose, likely reflecting essential transcriptional features of neoplastic transformation. In addition, we characterized a transcriptional profile that is commonly activated in various types of undifferentiated cancer, suggesting common molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells progress and avoid differentiation. Finally, we validated these transcriptional profiles on independent data sets.},

	abstract = {Expression, genetic variation, and tissues
Human genomes show extensive genetic variation across individuals, but we have only just started documenting the effects of this variation on the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, only a few tissues have been examined per genetic variant. In order to examine how genetic expression varies among tissues within individuals, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium collected 1641 postmortem samples covering 54 body sites from 175 individuals. They identified quantitative genetic traits that affect gene expression and determined which of these exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. Melé et al. measured how transcription varies among tissues, and Rivas et al. looked at how truncated protein variants affect expression across tissues.
Science, this issue p. 648, p. 660, p. 666; see also p. 640
Transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional processing underlie many cellular and organismal phenotypes. We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes—which is most clearly seen in blood—though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes.

We performed molecular clustering using data on chromosome-arm-level aneuploidy, DNA hypermethylation, mRNA, and miRNA expression levels and reverse-phase protein arrays, of which all, except for aneuploidy, revealed clustering primarily organized by histology, tissue type, or anatomic origin. The influence of cell type was evident in DNA-methylation-based clustering, even after excluding sites with known preexisting tissue-type-specific methylation. Integrative clustering further emphasized the dominant role of cell-of-origin patterns. Molecular similarities among histologically or anatomically related cancer types provide a basis for focused pan-cancer analyses, such as pan-gastrointestinal, pan-gynecological, pan-kidney, and pan-squamous cancers, and those related by stemness features, which in turn may inform strategies for future therapeutic development.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80\% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.},

We show that the rate of gene expression evolution varies among organs, lineages and chromosomes, owing to differences in selective pressures: transcriptome change was slow in nervous tissues and rapid in testes, slower in rodents than in apes and monotremes, and rapid for the X chromosome right after its formation. Although gene expression evolution in mammals was strongly shaped by purifying selection, we identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches, which occurred at different rates across lineages and tissues and which probably contributed to the specific organ biology of various mammals.},

We focus on “stage-associated genes” that capture specific transcriptional activities in each stage and use them to map pairwise stages within and between the two species by a hypergeometric test. Within each species, temporally adjacent stages exhibit high transcriptome similarity, as expected. Additionally, fly female adults and worm adults are mapped with fly and worm embryos, respectively, due to maternal gene expression. Between fly and worm, an unexpected strong collinearity is observed in the time course from early embryos to late larvae. Moreover, a second parallel pattern is found between fly prepupae through adults and worm late embryos through adults, consistent with the second large wave of cell proliferation and differentiation in the fly life cycle. The results indicate a partially duplicated developmental program in fly. Our results constitute the first comprehensive comparison between D. melanogaster and C. elegans developmental time courses and provide new insights into similarities in their development . We use an analogous approach to compare tissues and cells from fly and worm. Findings include strong transcriptome similarity of fly cell lines, clustering of fly adult tissues by origin regardless of sex and age, and clustering of worm tissues and dissected cells by developmental stage. Gene ontology analysis supports our results and gives a detailed functional annotation of different stages, tissues and cells. Finally, we show that standard correlation analyses could not effectively detect the mappings found by our method.},

By comparing organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning {\textasciitilde}350 million years of evolution, we observed significant differences in alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate lineages, with the highest complexity in primates. Within 6 million years, the splicing profiles of physiologically equivalent organs diverged such that they are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to organ type. Most vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are cis-directed. However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are predicted to remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators. These events likely further contributed to the diversification of splicing and other transcriptomic changes that underlie phenotypic differences among vertebrate species.
The patterns and complexity of messenger RNA splicing across vertebrates cluster by species rather than by organ.

Understanding tumor origins and the similarities and differences between organ-specific cancers is important for determining treatment options. Young et al. generated more than 72,000 single-cell transcriptomes from healthy and cancerous human kidneys. From these data, they determined that Wilms tumor, a pediatric kidney cancer, originates from aberrant fetal cells, whereas adult kidney cancers are likely derived from a specific subtype of proximal convoluted tubular cell.
Science, this issue p. 594
Messenger RNA encodes cellular function and phenotype. In the context of human cancer, it defines the identities of malignant cells and the diversity of tumor tissue. We studied 72,501 single-cell transcriptomes of human renal tumors and normal tissue from fetal, pediatric, and adult kidneys. We matched childhood Wilms tumor with specific fetal cell types, thus providing evidence for the hypothesis that Wilms tumor cells are aberrant fetal cells. In adult renal cell carcinoma, we identified a canonical cancer transcriptome that matched a little-known subtype of proximal convoluted tubular cell. Analyses of the tumor composition defined cancer-associated normal cells and delineated a complex vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling circuit. Our findings reveal the precise cellular identities and compositions of human kidney tumors.

In addition, T-cell activation generally requires binding of this same pMHC to a CD4 or CD8 coreceptor. Here, we report the structure of a complete TCR–pMHC–CD4 ternary complex involving a human autoimmune TCR, a myelin-derived self-peptide bound to HLA-DR4, and CD4. The complex resembles a pointed arch in which TCR and CD4 are each tilted ∼65° relative to the T-cell membrane. By precluding direct contacts between TCR and CD4, the structure explains how TCR and CD4 on the T cell can simultaneously, yet independently, engage the same pMHC on the APC. The structure, in conjunction with previous mutagenesis data, places TCR-associated CD3εγ and CD3εδ subunits, which transmit activation signals to the T cell, inside the TCR–pMHC–CD4 arch, facing CD4. By establishing anchor points for TCR and CD4 on the T-cell membrane, the complex provides a basis for understanding how the CD4 coreceptor focuses TCR on MHC to guide TCR docking on pMHC during thymic T-cell selection.},

Nevertheless, these approaches typically recover substantially less information per-cell as compared to lower-throughput microtiter plate-based strategies. To uncover critical phenotypic differences among cells and effectively link scRNA-Seq observations to legacy datasets, reliable detection of phenotype-defining transcripts - such as transcription factors, affinity receptors, and signaling molecules - by these methods is essential. Here, we describe a substantially improved massively-parallel scRNA-Seq protocol we term Seq-Well S{\textasciicircum}3 ("Second-Strand Synthesis") that increases the efficiency of transcript capture and gene detection by up to 10- and 5-fold, respectively, relative to previous iterations, surpassing best-in-class commercial analogs. We first characterized the performance of Seq-Well S{\textasciicircum}3 in cell lines and PBMCs, and then examined five different inflammatory skin diseases, illustrative of distinct types of inflammation, to explore the breadth of potential immune and parenchymal cell states. Our work presents an essential methodological advance as well as a valuable resource for studying the cellular and molecular features that inform human skin inflammation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Non-lymphoid tissues (NLTs) harbor a pool of adaptive immune cells with largely unexplored phenotype and development. We used single-cell RNA-seq to characterize 35,000 CD4+ regulatory (Treg) and memory (Tmem) T cells in mouse skin and colon, their respective draining lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen. In these tissues, we identified Treg cell subpopulations with distinct degrees of NLT phenotype. Subpopulation pseudotime ordering and gene kinetics were consistent in recruitment to skin and colon, yet the initial NLT-priming in LNs and the final stages of NLT functional adaptation reflected tissue-specific differences. Predicted kinetics were recapitulated using an in vivo melanoma-induction model, validating key regulators and receptors. Finally, we profiled human blood and NLT Treg and Tmem cells, and identified cross-mammalian conserved tissue signatures. In summary, we describe the relationship between Treg cell heterogeneity and recruitment to NLTs through the combined use of computational prediction and in vivo validation.},

              to self and environmental stimuli. It is now appreciated that
              Treg cells acquire tissue-specific adaptations that facilitate
              their survival and function; however, key host factors
              controlling the Treg response in the intestine are poorly
              understood. The interleukin (IL)-1 family member IL-33 is
              constitutively expressed in epithelial cells at barrier sites,
              where it functions as an endogenous danger signal, or alarmin, in
              response to tissue damage. Recent studies in humans have
              described high levels of IL-33 in inflamed lesions of
              inflammatory bowel disease patients, suggesting a role for this
              cytokine in disease pathogenesis. In the intestine, both
              protective and pathological roles for IL-33 have been described
              in murine models of acute colitis, but its contribution to
              chronic inflammation remains ill defined. Here we show in mice
              that the IL-33 receptor ST2 is preferentially expressed on
              colonic Treg cells, where it promotes Treg function and
              adaptation to the inflammatory environment. IL-33 signalling in T
              cells stimulates Treg responses in several ways. First, it
              enhances transforming growth factor (TGF)-$\beta$1-mediated
              differentiation of Treg cells and, second, it provides a
              necessary signal for Treg-cell accumulation and maintenance in
              inflamed tissues. Strikingly, IL-23, a key pro-inflammatory
              cytokine in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease,
              restrained Treg responses through inhibition of IL-33
              responsiveness. These results demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized
              link between an endogenous mediator of tissue damage and a major
              anti-inflammatory pathway, and suggest that the balance between
              IL-33 and IL-23 may be a key controller of intestinal immune

              gene expression profiling across complex tissues are lacking. RNA

              Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer
              cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data
              with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851

              confirmed Seurat's accuracy using several experimental

              alteration leads to the development of autoimmune disease in

              CD25+CD4+ regulatory T cells are produced by the normal thymus as

              Their repertoire of antigen specificities is as broad as that of
              naive T cells, and they are capable of recognizing both self and
              nonself antigens, thus enabling them to control various immune
              responses. In addition to antigen recognition, signals through
              various accessory molecules and via cytokines control their
              activation, expansion, and survival, and tune their suppressive
              activity. Furthermore, the generation of CD25+CD4+ regulatory T

              Invariably, this has required enzymatic incubation at 37°C, which
              can be expected to result in artifactual changes in gene
              expression patterns. Here, we describe a dissociation method that
              uses a protease with high activity in the cold, purified from a
              psychrophilic microorganism. The entire procedure is carried out
              at 6°C or colder, at which temperature mammalian transcriptional
              machinery is largely inactive, thereby effectively 'freezing in'
              the gene expression patterns. To test this method, we carried out
              RNA-seq on 20,424 single cells from postnatal day 1 mouse

              identifying switch-like differential expression of genes along

With this comprehensive breadth comes a major analytical challenge. The same cell type across tissues, from different donors, or in different disease states, may appear to express different genes. A joint analysis of multiple datasets requires the integration of cells across diverse conditions. This is particularly challenging when datasets are assayed with different technologies in which real biological differences are interspersed with technical differences. We present Harmony, an algorithm that projects cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather than dataset-specific conditions. Unlike available single-cell integration methods, Harmony can simultaneously account for multiple experimental and biological factors. We develop objective metrics to evaluate the quality of data integration. In four separate analyses, we demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to four single-cell-specific integration algorithms. Moreover, we show that Harmony requires dramatically fewer computational resources. It is the only available algorithm that makes the integration of \textit{∼} 10$^{\textrm{6}}$ cells feasible on a personal computer. We demonstrate that Harmony identifies both broad populations and fine-grained subpopulations of PBMCs from datasets with large experimental differences. In a meta-analysis of 14,746 cells from 5 studies of human pancreatic islet cells, Harmony accounts for variation among technologies and donors to successfully align several rare subpopulations. In the resulting integrated embedding, we identify a previously unidentified population of potentially dysfunctional alpha islet cells, enriched for genes active in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress response. The abundance of these alpha cells correlates across donors with the proportion of dysfunctional beta cells also enriched in ER stress response genes. Harmony is a fast and flexible general purpose integration algorithm that enables the identification of shared fine-grained subpopulations across a variety of experimental and biological conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The algorithm is based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs by means of alternation of two operators, expansion and inflation. The results in [8] establish an intrinsic relationship between the corresponding algebraic process (MCL process) and cluster structure in the iterands and the limits of the process. Several kinds of experiments conducted with the MCL algorithm are described here. Test cases with varying homogeneity characteristics are used to establish some of the particular strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm. In general the algorithm performs well, except for graphs which are very homogeneous (such as weakly connected grids) and for which the natural cluster diameter (i.e. the diameter of a subgraph induced by a natural cluster) is large.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed risk alleles for ulcerative colitis (UC). To understand their cell type specificities and pathways of action, we generate an atlas of 366,650 cells from the colon mucosa of 18 UC patients and 12 healthy individuals, revealing 51 epithelial, stromal, and immune cell subsets, including BEST4+ enterocytes, microfold-like cells, and IL13RA2+IL11+ inflammatory fibroblasts, which we associate with resistance to anti-TNF treatment. Inflammatory fibroblasts, inflammatory monocytes, microfold-like cells, and T cells that co-express CD8 and IL-17 expand with disease, forming intercellular interaction hubs. Many UC risk genes are cell type specific and co-regulated within relatively few gene modules, suggesting convergence onto limited sets of cell types and pathways. Using this observation, we nominate and infer functions for specific risk genes across GWAS loci.

Immune cells residing in white adipose tissue have been highlighted as important factors contributing to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases, but the molecular regulators that drive adipose tissue immune cell remodeling during obesity remain largely unknown. Using index and transcriptional single-cell sorting, we comprehensively map all adipose tissue immune populations in both mice and humans during obesity. We describe a novel and conserved Trem2+ lipid-associated macrophage (LAM) subset and identify markers, spatial localization, origin, and functional pathways associated with these cells. Genetic ablation of Trem2 in mice globally inhibits the downstream molecular LAM program, leading to adipocyte hypertrophy as well as systemic hypercholesterolemia, body fat accumulation, and glucose intolerance. These findings identify Trem2 signaling as a major pathway by which macrophages respond to loss of tissue-level lipid homeostasis, highlighting Trem2 as a key sensor of metabolic pathologies across multiple tissues and a potential therapeutic target in metabolic diseases.},

A comprehensive cellular anatomy of normal human prostate is essential for solving the cellular origins of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. The tools used to analyze the contribution of individual cell types are not robust. We provide a cellular atlas of the young adult human prostate and prostatic urethra using an iterative process of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and flow cytometry on ∼98,000 cells taken from different anatomical regions. Immunohistochemistry with newly derived cell type-specific markers revealed the distribution of each epithelial and stromal cell type on whole mounts, revising our understanding of zonal anatomy. Based on discovered cell surface markers, flow cytometry antibody panels were designed to improve the purification of each cell type, with each gate confirmed by scRNA-seq. The molecular classification, anatomical distribution, and purification tools for each cell type in the human prostate create a powerful resource for experimental design in human prostate disease.},

From this data, we infer differentiation trajectories from HSC/MPPs, and evaluate the impact of tissue microenvironment on blood and immune cell development. We predict coupling of mast cell differentiation with erythro-megakaryopoiesis and identify physiological erythropoiesis in fetal skin. We demonstrate a shift in fetal liver haematopoietic composition during gestation away from being erythroid-predominant, accompanied by a parallel change in HSC/MPP differentiation potential, which we functionally validate. Our integrated map of fetal liver haematopoiesis provides a blueprint for the study of paediatric blood and immune disorders, and a valuable reference for understanding and harnessing the therapeutic potential of HSC/MPPs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Lymphatic vessels form a critical component in the regulation of human health and disease. While their functional significance is increasingly being recognized, the comprehensive heterogeneity of lymphatics remains uncharacterized. Here, we report the profiling of 33,000 lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in human lymph nodes (LNs) by single-cell RNA sequencing. Unbiased clustering revealed six major types of human LECs. LECs lining the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of LNs abundantly expressed neutrophil chemoattractants, whereas LECs lining the medullary sinus (MS) expressed a C-type lectin CD209. Binding of a carbohydrate Lewis X (CD15) to CD209 mediated neutrophil binding to the MS. The neutrophil-selective homing by MS LECs may retain neutrophils in the LN medulla and allow lymph-borne pathogens to clear, preventing their spread through LNs in humans. Our study provides a comprehensive characterization of LEC heterogeneity and unveils a previously undefined role for medullary LECs in human immunity.},

Spermatogenesis has been intensely studied in rodents but remains poorly understood in humans. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze human testes. Clustering analysis of neonatal testes reveals several cell subsets, including cell populations with characteristics of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). In adult testes, we identify four undifferentiated spermatogonia (SPG) clusters, each of which expresses specific marker genes. We identify protein markers for the most primitive SPG state, allowing us to purify this likely SSC-enriched cell subset. We map the timeline of male germ cell development from PGCs through fetal germ cells to differentiating adult SPG stages. We also define somatic cell subsets in both neonatal and adult testes and trace their developmental trajectories. Our data provide a blueprint of the developing human male germline and supporting somatic cells. The PGC-like and SSC markers are candidates to be used for SSC therapy to treat infertility.},

Spermatogenesis, including meiosis, was reconstructed computationally, revealing sequential coding, non-coding, and repeat-element transcriptional signatures. Interestingly, we identified five discrete transcriptional/developmental spermatogonial states, including a novel early SSC state, termed State 0. Epigenetic features and nascent transcription analyses suggested developmental plasticity within spermatogonial States. To understand the origin of State 0, we profiled testicular cells from infants, and identified distinct similarities between adult State 0 and infant SSCs.

The mammalian kidney develops through reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the metanephric mesenchyme to give rise to the entire collecting system and the nephrons. Most of our knowledge of the developmental regulators driving this process arises from the study of gene expression and functional genetics in mice and other animal models. In order to shed light on human kidney development, we have used single-cell transcriptomics to characterize gene expression in different cell populations, and to study individual cell dynamics and lineage trajectories during development. Single-cell transcriptome analyses of 6414 cells from five individual specimens identified 11 initial clusters of specific renal cell types as defined by their gene expression profile. Further subclustering identifies progenitors, and mature and intermediate stages of differentiation for several renal lineages. Other lineages identified include mesangium, stroma, endothelial and immune cells. Novel markers for these cell types were revealed in the analysis, as were components of key signaling pathways driving renal development in animal models. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive and dynamic gene expression profile of the developing human kidney at the single-cell level.},

The human brain is built in an inside-out manner as a series of layers. Although progenitor cells spin off new neurons in a seemingly organized fashion, the devil is in the details. Nowakowski et al. analyzed the transcriptomes of single cells from the developing brain to elucidate the hidden complexity of brain construction. For each cell, its position within the brain matters, as well as what type of neuron is being made at what point during overall development. These individual expression patterns result in organized diversity in the brain's cortex.
Science, this issue p. 1318
Systematic analyses of spatiotemporal gene expression trajectories during organogenesis have been challenging because diverse cell types at different stages of maturation and differentiation coexist in the emerging tissues. We identified discrete cell types as well as temporally and spatially restricted trajectories of radial glia maturation and neurogenesis in developing human telencephalon. These lineage-specific trajectories reveal the expression of neurogenic transcription factors in early radial glia and enriched activation of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling in outer radial glia. Across cortical areas, modest transcriptional differences among radial glia cascade into robust typological distinctions among maturing neurons. Together, our results support a mixed model of topographical, typological, and temporal hierarchies governing cell-type diversity in the developing human telencephalon, including distinct excitatory lineages emerging in rostral and caudal cerebral cortex.
Location, type, and time all cooperate to diversify individual progenitors and neurons of the developing human brain.

Understanding human embryonic ventral midbrain is of major interest for Parkinson’s disease. However, the cell types, their gene expression dynamics, and their relationship to commonly used rodent models remain to be defined. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing to examine ventral midbrain development in human and mouse. We found 25 molecularly defined human cell types, including five subtypes of radial glia-like cells and four progenitors. In the mouse, two mature fetal dopaminergic neuron subtypes diversified into five adult classes during postnatal development. Cell types and gene expression were generally conserved across species, but with clear differences in cell proliferation, developmental timing, and dopaminergic neuron development. Additionally, we developed a method to quantitatively assess the fidelity of dopaminergic neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells, at a single-cell level. Thus, our study provides insight into the molecular programs controlling human midbrain development and provides a foundation for the development of cell replacement therapies.},

Hormone-secreting cells within pancreatic islets of Langerhans play important roles in metabolic homeostasis and disease. However, their transcriptional characterization is still incomplete. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of thousands of human islet cells from healthy and type 2 diabetic donors. We could define specific genetic programs for each individual endocrine and exocrine cell type, even for rare δ, γ, ε, and stellate cells, and revealed subpopulations of α, β, and acinar cells. Intriguingly, δ cells expressed several important receptors, indicating an unrecognized importance of these cells in integrating paracrine and systemic metabolic signals. Genes previously associated with obesity or diabetes were found to correlate with BMI. Finally, comparing healthy and T2D transcriptomes in a cell-type resolved manner uncovered candidates for future functional studies.

To understand organ function, it is important to have an inventory of its cell types and of their corresponding marker genes. This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues like the pancreas, because reliable markers are limited. Hence, transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of Langerhans, obscuring contributions from rare cell types and of potential subpopulations. To overcome this challenge, we developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells. We also show that CD24 and TM4SF4 expression can be used to sort live alpha and beta cells with high purity.

Although the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures. Here we implemented a droplet-based, single-cell RNA-seq method to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two mouse strains. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare epsilon-cells; exocrine cell types; vascular cells; Schwann cells; quiescent and activated stellate cells; and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta- cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER stress. Finally, we deconvolved bulk gene expression samples using the single-cell data to detect disease-associated differential expression. Our dataset provides a resource for the discovery of novel cell type-specific transcription factors, signaling receptors, and medically relevant genes.},

To facilitate the detection of rare cellular states and uncover population heterogeneity, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on islets from multiple deceased organ donors, including children, healthy adults, and individuals with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. We developed a robust computational biology framework for cell type annotation. Using this framework, we show that α- and β-cells from children exhibit less well-defined gene signatures than those in adults. Remarkably, α- and β-cells from donors with type 2 diabetes have expression profiles with features seen in children, indicating a partial dedifferentiation process. We also examined a naturally proliferating α-cell from a healthy adult, for which pathway analysis indicated activation of the cell cycle and repression of checkpoint control pathways. Importantly, this replicating α-cell exhibited activated Sonic hedgehog signaling, a pathway not previously known to contribute to human α-cell proliferation. Our study highlights the power of single-cell RNA-seq and provides a stepping stone for future explorations of cellular heterogeneity in pancreatic endocrine cells.},

In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue specificity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that the regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are \textit{not} highly targeted in their corresponding tissue network. However, they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue specificity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Human genomes show extensive genetic variation across individuals, but we have only just started documenting the effects of this variation on the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, only a few tissues have been examined per genetic variant. In order to examine how genetic expression varies among tissues within individuals, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium collected 1641 postmortem samples covering 54 body sites from 175 individuals. They identified quantitative genetic traits that affect gene expression and determined which of these exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. Melé et al. measured how transcription varies among tissues, and Rivas et al. looked at how truncated protein variants affect expression across tissues.

Understanding the functional consequences of genetic variation, and how it affects complex human disease and quantitative traits, remains a critical challenge for biomedicine. We present an analysis of RNA sequencing data from 1641 samples across 43 tissues from 175 individuals, generated as part of the pilot phase of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We describe the landscape of gene expression across tissues, catalog thousands of tissue-specific and shared regulatory expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants, describe complex network relationships, and identify signals from genome-wide association studies explained by eQTLs. These findings provide a systematic understanding of the cellular and biological consequences of human genetic variation and of the heterogeneity of such effects among a diverse set of human tissues.
Sampling RNA from multiple tissues across the human body illuminates how genetic variation affects gene expression. [Also see Perspective by Gibson]

	abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

	abstract = {CD45 (lymphocyte common antigen) is a receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatase that is expressed on all leucocytes, and which plays a crucial role in the function of these cells. On T cells the extracellular domain of CD45 is expressed in several different isoforms, and the particular isoform(s) expressed depends on the particular subpopulation of cell, their state of maturation, and whether or not they have previously been exposed to antigen. It has been established that the expression of CD45 is essential for the activation of T cells via the TCR, and that different CD45 isoforms display a different ability to support T cell activation. Although the tyrosine phosphatase activity of the intracellular region of CD45 has been shown to be crucial for supporting signal transduction from the TCR, the nature of the ligands for the different isoforms of CD45 have been elusive. Moreover, the precise mechanism by which potential ligands may regulate CD45 function is unclear. Interestingly, in T cells CD45 has been shown to associate with numerous molecules, both membrane associated and intracellular; these include components of the TCR-CD3 complex and CD4/CD8. In addition, CD45 is reported to associate with several intracellular protein tyrosine kinases including p56lck and p59fyn of the src family, and ZAP-70 of the Syk family, and with numerous proteins of 29-34 kDa. These CD45-associated molecules may play an important role in regulating CD45 tyrosine phosphatase activity and function. However, although the role of some of the CD45-associated molecules (e.g. CD45-AP and LPAP) has become better understood in recent years, the role of others still remains obscure. This review aims to summarize recent findings on the role of CD45 and CD45-associated molecules in T cell activation, and to highlight issues that seem relevant to ongoing research in this area.},
